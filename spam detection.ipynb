        "*   **Data Acquisition and Exploration:** The SMS Spam Collection Dataset, comprising 5571 messages with two columns ('label' and 'message'), was successfully loaded. The dataset showed no missing values and a class imbalance with 4824 'ham' messages and 747 'spam' messages.\n",
        "*   **Text Preprocessing:** A custom function `preprocess_text` was applied, performing lowercasing, punctuation and number removal, stop word removal, and lemmatization. This created a 'cleaned_message' column ready for feature extraction.\n",
        "*   **Feature Extraction:** The `TfidfVectorizer` was used to convert the preprocessed text into a numerical feature matrix (X) with a shape of (5571, 7993), representing 5571 messages and 7993 unique terms.\n",
        "*   **Model Training:** The 'label' column was converted to numerical format (0 for 'ham', 1 for 'spam'), and the dataset was split into training and testing sets (80/20 split). A `MultinomialNB` classifier was successfully trained on the training data.\n",
        "*   **Model Performance:** On the test set, the `MultinomialNB` model achieved an accuracy of 0.9632, precision of 0.9917, recall of 0.7500, and an F1-score of 0.8541. The confusion matrix indicated strong performance in identifying 'ham' messages (low false positives) but a higher rate of false negatives for 'spam' messages.\n",
        "*   **New Message Classification:** The trained model successfully classified new, unseen messages. Both explicit spam examples (e.g., \"Congratulations! You've won a free iPhone. Claim now!\") and clear ham messages (e.g., \"Hey, just checking in. How are you doing today?\") were correctly identified.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   The model exhibits high precision, meaning when it flags a message as spam, it is highly likely to be correct. This is beneficial for minimizing false positives, which can be critical for user satisfaction (not filtering out legitimate emails).\n",
        "*   The lower recall (0.7500) suggests that the model still misses some spam messages (false negatives). Further optimization, such as experimenting with different models (e.g., SVM, Logistic Regression, deep learning), tuning hyperparameters, or incorporating advanced text features (e.g., n-grams, word embeddings), could improve the detection rate of spam.\n"
